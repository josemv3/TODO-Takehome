# TODO-Takehome

Welcome to the read me file for this project!

This application was originally conceived as a take-home project, but it has since evolved into a comprehensive learning tool that I have been able to continuously refine and enhance throughout the latter part of 2022.

Some of the key features and enhancements that have been incorporated into this project include:

-Implementation of data persistence using Codable, CoreData, and ultimately, Realm.

-Implementation of dependency injection, with the TODO item being injected into the TodoAddViewController.

-Adherence to the Human Interface Guidelines when utilizing Modular or Push Navigation controllers and stacks.

-Implementation of the Protocol/Delegate pattern for effective information transfer between ViewControllers.

-Enhancement of the data retrieval process, which now employs a non-optional Array rather than an optional Realm container.

-Utilization of computed properties to maintain a single, truthful version of the data.

Overall, this application serves as a demonstration of my ability to learn and implement new techniques and technologies, and I am proud to share it with the wider development community. Thank you for taking the time to explore this project!
